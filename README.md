The patching of Android kernel and Android system.

- A new kernel-based root solution for Android devices.
- APM: Support for modules similar to Magisk.
- KPM: Support for modules that allow you to inject any code into the kernel (Requires kernel function `inline-hook` and `syscall-table-hook` enabled).
- APatch relies on [KernelPatch](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch/).
- The APatch UI and the APModule source code have been derived and modified from [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU).

## Supported Versions

- Only supports the ARM64 architecture.
- Only supports Android kernel versions 3.18 - 6.1

Support for Samsung devices with security protection: Planned

## Requirement

Kernel configs:

- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y` and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y`

- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y` and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=n`: Initial support

## Security Alert

The **SuperKey** has higher privileges than root access.  
Weak or compromised keys can lead to unauthorized control of your device.  
It is critical to use robust keys and safeguard them from exposure to maintain the security of your device.
