The patching of Android kernel and Android system.

- A new Kernel-based root solution for Android devices.
- APM: Magisk module like support.
- KPM: Kernel Patch Module support. (Allow you to inject any code into the kernel, Kernel function inline-hook and syscall-table-hook is available)
- APatch relies on [KernelPatch](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch/).
- The source code for both APatch UI and APM has been copied and modified from [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU).

## Supported Versions

- ARM64 only
- Android Kernel Version 3.18 - 6.1

Support for Samsung devices with security protection: planned

## Requirement

Kernel configs

- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y` and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y`
- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y` and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=n`: Initial support

## Security Alert

The **SUPERKEY** has higher privileges than root access.  
Weak or compromised keys can result in unauthorized control of your device.  
It is critical to use robust keys and safeguard them from exposure to maintain the security of your device.
